# GJM_Particles-_Segregation
A tiny Arduboy game made in 64 hours !
My game is Particles' Segregation. In this game, your mission is to separate protons and electrons by storing them in their box to avoid explosion ! You will progress in 5 levels with an increasing difficulty. Good luck, and have fun !
I do not code a lot, so it's a messy code, but I did my best and I hope that you'll enjoy it !
